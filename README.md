This Tableau project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Electric Vehicle (EV) market, leveraging a real-world dataset updated until May 2024. The data includes sensitive and accurate entries which have undergone thorough cleaning and feature engineering processes to ensure reliability and relevance. 

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:
1. **Total Vehicles:**
   - Objective: To understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, including both Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), for assessing market size and growth.
2. **Average Electric Range:**
   - Objective: To determine the average electric range of the EVs in the dataset, providing insights into technological advancements and efficiency.
3. **Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles:**
   - Objective: To identify and analyze the total number of BEVs, and calculate their percentage relative to the total number of electric vehicles, highlighting the dominance of fully electric models.
4. **Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles:**
   - Objective: To identify and analyze the total number of PHEVs, and calculate their percentage relative to the total number of electric vehicles, offering insights into the market share of plug-in hybrid models.

## Features:
- **Total Vehicles by Model Year:** Displays the growth trend of EVs from 2011 to 2024.
- **Top 10 Vehicles by Make:** Highlights the most popular EV manufacturers, with Tesla leading the market.
